# LeetCode Problem Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in both Java and C++. The solutions cover a range of algorithmic challenges commonly found on LeetCode, including string manipulation, array processing, and classic problem-solving patterns.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language and then further by problem/topic:

```
├── C++
│   ├── AddTwoNumbers/
│   ├── MedianoTwoSortedArrays/
│   ├── TwoSum/
│   ├── longestSubstring/
│   └── README.md
├── Java/
│   ├── ConditionalsIf/
│   ├── StringSolving/
│   └── README.md
├── docs/
│   └── doc.md
├── translations/
│   └── README_ar.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

### Key Solution Folders

- **C++/AddTwoNumbers/**  
  Solution for the "Add Two Numbers" problem using singly-linked lists.
- **C++/MedianoTwoSortedArrays/**  
  Solution for finding the median of two sorted arrays.
- **C++/TwoSum/**  
  Solution for the classic "Two Sum" problem.
- **C++/longestSubstring/**  
  Implementation for finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Java/ConditionalsIf/**  
  Solutions demonstrating conditional logic, including a Blackjack card game logic.
- **Java/StringSolving/**  
  String manipulation problems and log formatting utilities.

## How to Use

Browse the language-specific folders (`C++` and `Java`) to find implementations of various LeetCode problems. Each problem typically contains a `README.md` and source code files demonstrating one or more approaches.

### Example: Running a Solution in Java

Navigate to the relevant Java folder and execute the main class, for example:
```bash
cd Java/StringSolving/src/main/java/com/mycompany/stringsolving
javac LogLevels.java
java com.mycompany.stringsolving.LogLevels
```

### Example: Running a Solution in C++

The C++ folders may contain Java code for demonstration purposes. Follow the same steps as above, replacing the package paths as needed.

## Documentation & Translations

- Additional documentation is available in the `docs/` directory.
- An Arabic translation of the readme is available under `translations/README_ar.md`.
